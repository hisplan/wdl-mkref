# wdl-mkref

Generating a hybrid (human + mouse) scRNA-seq STAR reference:

- Human (GRCh38) / Ensembl 98
- Mouse (GRCm38) / Ensembl 98

## Setup

Sharp is a part of SCING (Single-Cell pIpeliNe Garden; pronounced as "sing" /si≈ã/). For setup, please refer to [this page](https://github.com/hisplan/scing). All the instructions below is given under the assumption that you have already configured SCING in your environment.

## Create Job Files

You need two files to create a reference package - one inputs file and one labels file. Use the following example files to help you create your job file:

- `configs/template.inputs.json`
- `configs/template.labels.json`

## Input

Note that a reference package created using STAR v2.5.3a is not compatible with STAR v2.7.6a or vice versa.
